    <div class="pb3 mw6 pl5 pr5">
      <p>Created as a response to early design inspiration of part of the Aizone Brand Campaign that Sagmesiter & Walsh took on around 2013. The use of the body as a canvas was an incredibly interesting concept to me. I used this as the springboard for my own take on the structure of the pieces.
      </p>
      <p class="">Instead of focusing on a brand identity, I chose to focus on buzz words and terms of today in 2017. There was a 48 hour deadline put in place from conception, to development, photographing, and finalization.</p>
